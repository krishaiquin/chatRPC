# chatRPC
A lightweight distributed chat system designed to learn and explore remote procedure call (RPC) mechanisms.

Note: This project is inspired by concepts from UBCâ€™s Distributed Systems course (CPSC 416). I reimplemented the core RPC and node discovery mechanisms from scratch in Go to deepen my understanding of distributed systems, then extended it with my own design choices and improvements.
