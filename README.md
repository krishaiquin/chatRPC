# chatRPC
A self-directed project to build a distributed chat service from scratch in Go. Currently, it implements node discovery, allowing nodes to find and connect to each other. Future work includes adding messaging and group communication. Inspired by my university distributed systems course, but reimplemented independently to strengthen my understanding of networking, concurrency, and distributed coordination.
