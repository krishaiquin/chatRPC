## Legend
    ✅ Done 
    🚧 In Progress
    🔁 Deferred
## Weekly Tasks/Progress

### Week 1
    ✅ Set up simple transport layer - works only on system with only one function 
    ✅ Echo messages using RPC - created message service
### Week 2
    ✅ Expand transport layer to work on multiple functions
    ✅ Figure out how to create set of client nodes - added nodeset service
    ✅ Add daemon for message service
    ✅ Set up a db service to save the endpoints for different services 
### Week 3
    ✅ Fix all bugs and connected chat to all services (message, nodeset and db)
    ✅ Add quit command to chat
    🔁 Figure out how to broadcast messages 
    ✅ Re-design Nodeset - figure out how nodes would use it and how it should work
        IDEAS:
           
### Week 4
    🚧 Start rewriting Nodeset - for now focus on allow adding new nodes to the cluster. Worry about notifying other nodes later after transport layer is done
    [ ] Rewrite transport layer to allow nodes to listen for "Update Nodeset" requests for Nodeset service
<!-- [ ] Refactor RPC -->
<!-- [ ] Add context -->
<!-- [ ] Test program's functionality    -->
<!-- [ ] Add vector clocks for causality -->
<!-- [ ] Test vector clocks (simulate real-life node connection)  -->

### 💭 Notes / Design Insights
    - Nodeset design:
        - Initial Idea
            -  create a Node struct. This contains NodeId and its address
            -  create a Cluster struct. This contains "this Node" and other Nodes in the cluster (aka nodeset). This will help to know which Node sent which message.
            -  make nodeset field(Cluster struct) from []string into []Node.    
                Note: Drew a diagram and it doesn't look like there problem with nodes joining the cluster BUT I'm hitting a roadblock with figuring out how to let other nodes in the cluster know aboout the newly added node.
                    - This means that nodes will have to listen for "Update Nodeset" requests from Nodeset service. Need to rewrite transport layer to be able to allow this.
            - Node and Cluster creation is done in Nodeset service. A newly-joined node will send a request to Nodeset to add it  to the cluster. Nodeset service will return a Cluster
        - Problem: Node and Cluster structs are going to be pointers. When it gets to client-side, the addresses don't mean anything.
            - IDEAS for solution:
                - Create Node/Cluster locally in nodes
                - NodeId creation and cluster management is done in nodeset
                - Nodes requests Nodeset for NodeId creation
                - Nodes requests Nodeset to Add node to the cluster. Return nil (for now)
                - Nodes requests Nodeset for the list of nodes in the cluster. Return []Nodes
